# Evil Eve: How Eve has Been Represented in Media 

## Whos is Eve?

Every religion has a creation story. In Judaism and Christianity there is Genesis, the story of Adam and Eve. Genesis also appears in the Qur'an but with larger differences in plot than in the Hebrew or Christian bible. Genesis is said to be inspired by the Babylonian creation myth, Enuma Elish, where the creator of the world is a man, and the water that symbolizes chaos is represented as a woman. This would make sense because ancient Mesopotamia neighbored ancient Isreal. (Creation Adam and Eve p.97)  

We all generally know how the story goes, God created Adam on the sixth day, and from Adam’s rib he made Eve. Later Eve was tempted by the serpent to eat the forbidden fruit, which led to their expulsion from paradise. Since then, women have been cursed with menstruation, childbirth and subordination to men. Even if you know nothing about any of these three religions, this version of the story sounds about right, and you have probably seen a reference to it on TV before. Adam and Eve have been interpreted in many different ways, to display many different religious or societal values. Eve is a complex character, and she has been used in discussion surrounding women for centuries.  

## Eve in the Hebrew Bible 
Eve only appears twice in the Hebrew bible despite being arguably the best-known character. (Carol Mayers, p.15) The first account of Genesis was published in 400 B.C.E, during a time of hardship after the Babylonian exile. This version is closer to Enuma Elish. Adam and Eve are created as equals on the sixth day. The second version from 750 B.C.E, focuses more on the creation of humans and Eve was made as a helper to Adam. The third chapter of Gensis, where Eve eats from the tree of knowledge, resulting in God expelling the couple from Eden, is the continuation of the second account. (Creation Adam and Eve p.97)  

In Genesis 2:7, the phrase stating that God created the human has been mistranslated to mean God created the man. The Hebrew word ādām is said multiple places in the bible, but it has the definition of a human or a mortal not necessarily a male. Meyers states, “in any case, sex should not yet be assigned to “the human.” Indeed, without a pair of humans, one of each sex, a gendered category of humanity is meaningless.” (Meyers p.16) There are many words and phrases in Genesis that lose their original meaning in favor of presenting Eve as inferior to Adam.  

Others include the word sēlā, meaning side. This word has been translated to rib. When really it would mean that God takes a side of Adam, making Adam and Eve two halves of one whole. (Meyers p.17)  

The word kěnegdo, became “meet for him” as in “a helper meet for him.” Kěnegdo has a meaning closer to equivalent too or partnering, not subordinate. (Meyers p.17) 

In Genesis 3:16 God says that Adam will rule over Eve. However, the word mšl is used 80 other times in the bible to refer to political power, self-control, or God’s power, not to describe a relationship between a man and a woman. (Meyers p.22)  

God never explicitly curses Eve; he curses the snake and the earth but not Eve. (Meyers p.19) When handing out punishments for the transgression, only the serpent is explicitly cursed.  

The story of Genesis represents the time in which it was written, when daily life for the ancient Israelites involved farming on land that was not necessarily agriculturally productive. (Meyers p. 15) After Adam and Eve are expelled from paradise, they have to farm to survive. In Genesis 3:16, most translated to “in pain you shall bring forth children” most likely refers to the mental toil of having children, considering the fact of life in ancient societies infant mortality rate was very high. (Meyers p. 21) Women also held all the responsibility to provide food for their family. The serpent approaching Adam about food would have been outlandish. (Meyers p.19)  

In addition to Genesis there is another group of texts called “The Life of Adam and Eve,” about Adam and Eve’s life from their fall from paradise to their death. Much of it is told from Eve’s perspective. These works give her a kind of voice and agency. With this agency Eve puts the blame on herself, saying, “it is because of me the Lord God is angry with you.” (Parks p.43) when talking to Adam.  

Ben Shira is a huge part of the reason Eve received her reputation, “Shira’s vociferous misogyny is notorious.” (Parks p. 44) Shira wrote his teachings in 180 B.C.E. Later it became the book of Sirach, and he was one of the first to explicitly blame Eve for the fall, thus for all sin; “From a woman sin had its beginning, and because of her we all die.” (Sirach 25:24) With Shira’s influence, Eve became a figure that symbolizes all woman. According to Shira, all women have the capacity of “bringing despair and scandal to their husbands.” (Parks p.44) because of their inherent wickedness.  

## Eve in the Christian Bible 

Genesis and how it was perceived in the Christian faith is similar to Judaism, it is after all, the same story. What shapes religious beliefs is the variety of extra-scriptural texts that build upon the original story and the authors use it to express their own ideas.  

Saint Augustine, who lived from 354-430 CE (Parks p.42) wrote “The City of God.” In his work Augustine equates Eve’s sin of eating from the tree of knowledge as weakness and stupidity for succumbing to the serpent and Adam’s sin of also eating the fruit, as simply following Eve’s example and showing loyalty to his partner. "Not only does this paint Adam in a much more positive light than Eve, but it may be suggesting to male readers that listening to women could spell their downfall.” (Parks p.42) Augustine repeatedly argues that the woman must always be subordinate. If Eve sinned, clearly it is safer if all women are subordinate in society.  

Saint Jerome who lived around the same time as Augustine, from 340s to 420 B.C.E (Parks p.45) puts the blame for the fall onto women in general. “He does not even name Eve specifically, but simply refers to her as “a woman”—as though all women are likely candidates for the ruin of men.” (Parks p.45) Having a universal ideology about women leads to a complete mistrust of women, encouraging other men to distrust women, and excluding women from any positions of authority. Jerome preaches that men should beware, be vigilant of the women in their lives who try to lure them from divinity, just like Eve did to Adam for she was “the serpent’s agent.” (Parks p.45) 

Eve is mentioned by name only two times in the New Testament; 2 Corinthians 11: 3 and Timothy 2:13. (Robertson p.28) In a letter to the Corinthians Paul uses a metaphor about marriage to describe how he envisions his ministry with the Corinthians unfolding; “But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by its cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ.” (2 Corinthians 11:2-4) Paul wants the Corinthians to be untainted by the wrong beliefs, he wants them to be pure like a virgin. By using Eve in this metaphor, he is referring to her transgression as a sexual act, and as succumbing to temptation from the serpent.  

In Timothy 2:13 Eve’s sin is used to justify women’s place in society. “Just as Eve fell into sexual sin with the serpent, all women, according to the author, have the same proclivity toward sexual deviance,” (Robertson p. 35) According to the author all women have some tendencies to sexual deviance. Because of this, woman should then not be trusted with leadership.  

Both times Eve is mentioned in the New Testament, her sin is refered to as being a sexual act. A large reason why Eve’s transgression has been understood this way is due to 4 Maccabees 18:8. (Robertson p.31) Eve is not even named in this verse, but the “destructive lying snake” is. In this verse the snake's deception of Eve is equated to having sex. Paul’s understanding of Genesis, thus the author of Timothy 2:13 would have been influenced by Maccabees 18:8 and previous Jewish traditions and religious texts.  

## Eve in the Qur'an 

In the Qur'an, Q 2:30-38 focuses on the fall of Satan while, Q 7:11-25 focuses on the fall of humans. Q 20:115-27 has a lot of emphasis on Adam as a character. (Hadromi-Allouche p.89) Adam is largely considered to be a prophet in Islam because of his communication with God, even if it does not explicitly name him as one in the Qur’an. (Hadromi-Allouche p.91). This should mean that Eve was a prophet as well, but many figures in Islam deny that she was because the Qur’an does not acknowledge any female prophets. (Hadromi-Allouche p.98)  

The Qur'an has a more egalitarian telling of Genesis than the Bible. In the Qur'an Adam and Eve eat the forbidden fruit together. Eve is not written as a temptress to Adam, the blame for the fall is thus equally shared or blamed solely on Adam. (Hadromi-Allouche p.90) The most noticeable difference in the Qur’an compared to the bible is that Eve does not have much of a character at all. Zohar Hadromi-Allouche observes that “Qur'an 7:11–25 is the only qur'anic narration where Eve speaks (although only as part of a shared utterance with Adam).” (Hadromi-Allouche p. 90) There is a lack of importance on Eve and all the focus falls on Adam.  

The Qur’an does not explicitly explain how Eve was created, but early Islamic writings, mainly from Muqātil follow the Bible and say that Eve was made from Adam’s rib, or in Q4:1 that God created humanity from a single soul and then created a spouse for that soul. (Hadromi-Allouche p.94)  

However, the biggest branch of Islam, the Shitte people, reject this narrative, “First, it offends God’s omnipotence: why would God need to create Eve from Adam’s rib. Second, deriving Eve from Adam’s body implies that, during intercourse, Adam would be having sex with himself.” (Hadromi-Allouche p.94) They believe Adam and Eve were both their own separate creation. This opinion is backed up by Eve receiving her name from God rather than from Adam because, “it situates the naming hierarchy between God and humans, rather than between man and woman.” (Hadromi-Allouche p.94)  

The moral of the story in the Qur’an is divine forgiveness and it “diminishes the impact of the transgression” (Hadromi-Allouche p.92) God grants forgiveness to Adam which enhances his positive portrayal as a prophet. Since Eve is so connected to him this allows for some positive portrayals of her as well, like a report by Ibn Hishām who wrote that Eve warned Adam not to eat the fruit. (Hardromi Allouche p.95) This account, however, is often forgotten in favor of the story we recognize today, where Eve’s actions affect all womankind.  

Islamic tradition follows Genesis and Jewish and Christian influence though the reports of Tha’labi, who wrote that after the fall, Adam was given five curses, Saten ten, and Eve a whopping fifteen. Eve’s curses include labour, pregnancy pain and menstruation as a reminder that Eve spilled the blood of Adam. (Hadromi Allouche p.96)  

## Eve in Art 

Adam and Eve appear in a lot of, what is largely considered the best artworks of all time. A prime example is the centerpiece of the Sistine Chapel ceiling by Michelangelo. Showing God giving life to Adam, this image of the almost touching fingertips is easily recognizable and has been emulated in art many times. This piece is obviously focused on Adam and man, but Eve is there too. Many believe that it is Eve peeking out from under God’s arm, which could symbolize a belief that Eve was a preconceived creation, and not just a part of Adam.

The Fall and Expulsion from Paradise, which is also a part of the Sistine Chapel ceiling, has been portrayed over and over particularly during the renaissance. Eve takes the fruit from the serpent who is also depicted as a woman. Julia Fiore writes in a blog piece, "If wickedness (as in the serpent who represents the devil) is associated with femininity even before Eve gives Adam the Forbidden Fruit, which came first, woman or sin?” (Fiore) Then on the right the couple is banished from paradise, and they cower away in shame.

Many artists like Michelangelo took inspiration from the many other depictions of the first couple that were heavily circulated in the art world at the time.  

Adam and Eve, an engraving by Albrecht Dürer from 1504 became a sort of blueprint for how the couple came to be portrayed. Because of the invention of printing this piece was able to circulate through Europe and reach a large audience. (Lydia Figes)

Though art Eve became a symbol of desire, temptation and beauty. Eve can also be linked to many other Goddesses throughout ancient history, such as Aphrodite the Greek Goddess of love and fertility who has a similar reputation to Eve and is about as well known. Aphrodite has also been depicted with an apple, the Trojan prince Paris gifting her a golden apple. Aphrodite’s seduction is so powerful it sparked the Trojan war. (Figes)

One of the most famous depictions of Genesis, made between 1490 and 1510, is The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch. It is packed with symbolism and religious interpretations. What makes this painting so famous is how weird and detailed it is. In the left panel of the triptych the only human figures are Adam, Eve and God, who looks a lot more like the paintings of Jesus at the time. (A. Sullivan p.167) It does not show their creation but their marriage, art historians believe this scene has an “unmistakable erotic character.” (A. Sullivan p.165) because the figures make no effort to cover their nakedness.

There is less Islamic art that depicts the Genesis story, but in this page from a manuscript published in 1538, Adam and Eve are shown standing in the garden with halos over their heads, a symbol meant to distinguish prophets. (Robertson p.99) As I mentioned earlier, Adam is a prophet, while Eve’s status is debated. This page could be a contribution in favor of Eve’s status as a prophet.

## The Apple Does Not Fall Far From the Tree: Eve in Pop Culture 

## The Original Femme Fatale 

There is a wide array of extra-scriptural writings, discussions and thoughts, like the ones outlined above, that have influenced how and why we have certain depictions of Eve in our minds to this day. 

The oxford dictionary defines a femme fatal as, “An attractive and seductive woman, especially one who is likely to cause distress or disaster to a man who becomes involved with her.” A femme fatale is a woman who uses her sexuality to get power over a man.  

The femme fatale concept is present in literature, films, and music. This type of lethal beauty became an extremely popular trope in film noire.  

 “Cause everybody knows (She's a femme fatale)  
The things she does to please (she’s a femme fatale)   
She’s just a little tease,” this song by the velvet underground was written as a tribute to honor an iconic beauty. It is a loving portrayal of femme fatal, Edie Sedgwick.

Eve is pretty much perceived as a femme fatale in the western imagination, since Eve's sin has been turned into a sexual act, and this inherent sinfulness is passed down to all women. Women are often deemed as a femme fatale character, and blamed for how men treat them. Eve/women seduce Adam/men and lead them to make bad decisions. This stereotype can be observed in something as trivial as dress codes in school. Girls are blamed for distracting the boys in class because of a spaghetti strap, or shorts that do not go past their fingertips. But in reality, the girl is not being seductive or tempting, she is just existing.  

The jezebel stereotype, perhaps the predecessor to the femme fatale, derived from stereotypes surrounding Eve. In the Hebrew bible Jezebel was responsible for killing the prophets of Yahweh. Calling a woman a Jezebel is meant to insult a promiscuous and fallen woman. This stereotype has been linked to violence, particularly against black women. There has been a study done by the Psychology of Women Quarterly on how endorsing the jezebel stereotype leads to intimate partner violence towards black women. The authors explain how, “although characteristics of the Jezebel, such as being hypersexual, can be targeted at women from all racial ethnic backgrounds, the Jezebel stereotype has been used to historically denigrate Black women.” (Cheeseborough, Overstreet, Ward) 

In the Handmaid’s tale by Margerete Atwood, as well as the TV show that was adapted from that book, “Jezebels” is used as the name for the brothel in Gilead, where the commanders and men in power go to cheat on their wives. To be a jezebel is to be of the lowest ranked women in society, the last of their worth is measured by their sex appeal. Women become jezebels as punishment and to keep them controlled.
