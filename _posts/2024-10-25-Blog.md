# Baule Figure Sculpture
The Baul people who live near the ivory coast in west Africa have traditions of sculpting figures to represent a multitude of sprits for different reasons. Recognizing their ancestors is an important aspect of Baule culture, but they do not make statues of the dead because their spirit is kept in other ways.  

I am going to write specifically on the Blolo Bia and Blolo Bla sculptures, which are the male and female version of the same art form. Bia meaning man and Bla meaning woman. Prior to being born everyone is believed to have a spouse and or children in the other world. When a person is born their spirit spouse manifests in the physical world crafted as a wooden statue usually under two feet and polished in palm oil. These sculptures also represent the opposite or inverse of its owner.

###### Unknown artist. Female Spirit Spouse (Blolo Bla). Late 19th to Early 20th century. Wood and coral, 13 5/8 x 3 x 3 ½ (34.6cm x 7.6cm x 8.9cm). Chazen Museum of Art, Wisconsin, USA. 


A sculpture would have different adornments or markings to signify bringing prosperity or luck or success into the owner's life.  

A women would keep a Blolo Bia (spirit husband) in her home often in her bedroom, and a man would have a Blolo Bla as a spirit wife. These sculptures are not used in distinct or in particular ceremonies or worship. They are used in private everyday life, they are washed, polished, dressed and given offerings by their owners daily or almost daily.  

Once the owner of the figure dies there is no more need for the sculpture to be kept, unless it is a keepsake for the living family.  

Baule people believe that there are consequences that appear in the physical world when they are connected to their spirit spouse. Gender roles are enforced and demonstrated in a way though the Blolo Blas and Bias. If a woman wanted to become pregnant, “she could not unless her male spirit "unbound" her womb. That is, her maleness would have to be pushed aside into the Blolo Bia figure to allow her to become completely female.” observed Susan Mullin Vogel.  



Baule people do not need to necessarily ask guidance or forgiveness from their spirit spouse but are bound to them in a spiritual way. 

The spirits that inhabit the sculptures are known to be mischievous. They get jealous of the earthly lovers of their owner. If the figure is not given proper respect, they can let bad fortune enter the owner’s life. They frequently reveal themselves in sexual dreams. On certain days, the owner of the sculpture will sleep completely alone to be with their spirit spouse in the spirit world.
